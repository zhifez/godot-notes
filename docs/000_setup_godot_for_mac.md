# Setup Godot for Mac

To setup Godot on Mac so that you can do some basic controls (rotate/pan scene) using a trackpad:

1. On the toolbar, go to **Editor > Editor Settings**
2. In **Editor Settings** window, go to **Editors > 3D > Navigation**
3. Make sure both **Emulate Numpad** and **Emulate 3 Button Mouse** are set to ON.
4. Close the **Editor Settings** window, and you should be able to rotate scene by holding the **Option** key, pan across the scene by holding the **Shift** key.
